# Java-app-for-boolean-search-for-recruiters
I'm tasked with a small Java project but, can't really kick it off. I would highly appreciate it if anyone could help me.
I would highly appreciate it if anyone could help me, the details are below.

The success criteria:

The program should have a welcome page where the user is presented with the option for the program to either only generate a Boolean string which the user will then be able to use to search sources manually, or the user can choose that the program will generate and execute (through a search engine) a Boolean search.
The welcome page and the subsequent pages should present a simple and intuitive GUI, which is based on the dark blue color and a specific font (that is not standard).
Allow for different kinds of search criteria, such as “Job Title”, “Skills”, and “Other factors” (which can include things like geographical location, salary, whether the candidate can work remotely, languages spoken, etc.).
Allow for different levels of importance of criteria within the search, such as “must-have”, “nice to have”, and “to exclude”.
Suggest synonyms for the entered search terms to increase the amount of results of the Search.
Create a Boolean search string for the user-inputted criteria.
Execute the Boolean search through a web browser.
Establish which results from the search are candidate profiles and discard extraneous results.
Assign candidates a ranking based on the number of criteria they fulfill by giving them points for each “nice to have” criterion (if a candidate doesn’t meet the “must-have” criteria, they will not be considered).
Compile a list of candidates with links to their profiles in the ranked order.
Allow the user to export the list of candidates for further processing.
